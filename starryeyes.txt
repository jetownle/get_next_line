Just remember to be yourself in here.
Sarah, thank you for coming.
Thank you for having me.
You're just as beautiful in person as you are on the audition tapes.
Thank you. I didn't realize I was being taped.
Well, I am excited, Sarah.
We audition a lot of young women in this building but very, very few ever make it to this room.
Wow, that's great.
Yes, we've had our share of winners, some pretty big names have passed right through here, going way back.
So, did you like our little yarn?
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.
Good. I have high hopes for this picture.
Yes. It's kind of my love letter to this town.
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.
Everyone has it. But how many act on it?
That's what intrigues me.
That's what lights me up as they say.
There's something primal there and that's why you're sitting right here in this room.
But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
Of course.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
This industry is a plague Sarah, a plague of unoriginality, hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.
Yes, it's a plague alright.
And what does every plague have a lot of?
Rats?
Precisely.
Yes, thousands of them, hungry little rats, hungry for the cheese.
You cut through the fog of this town and you get desperation, plastic parishioners worshiping their deity of debauchery.
But that's what I find interesting, Sarah.
That's what I want to capture in this film, the ugliness of the human spirit.
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.
So why do you do it, darling?
Why, why do I do what?
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?
I... It's just a habit.
I started doing it when I was a little girl and... it helps me focus on the moment.
The moment.
Well, this is a moment.
Yes, yes it is.
